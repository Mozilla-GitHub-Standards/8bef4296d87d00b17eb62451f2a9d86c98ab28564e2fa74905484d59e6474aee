  "description": "Pioneer is an opt-in program that allows collection of richer data from Firefox. \n\nPioneers are willing to contribute sensitive data to help make Firefox better. Once you have opted into the group or installed the add-on, you'll be included in studies about how you use the browser. Some of these studies will be passive and simply listen. Others may alter the behavior of your browser a little bit to see if it improves how you browse the web. Others may occasionally ask a question to help us understand how youâ€™re interacting with a page. \n\nTo learn more about Pioneer, see https://medium.com/@tobyelliott/10c82d0f9301",
